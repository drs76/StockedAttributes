# Stocked Attributes - Business Central Application

This application allows the items to be stocked at attribute level using variants.  A template of Stocked Attributes will be
setup on required items, using the Create Variants functionality an item variant will be created for each unique combination of the
item attributes.

An entry page will allow selection of variant by attribute on un-posted documents and item journals.

Fast search option available.
